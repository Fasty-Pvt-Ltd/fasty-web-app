## Disclosure Process

Once a vulnerability is reported:

1. We will acknowledge receipt as soon as possible
2. We will investigate and assess the impact
3. We will work on a fix and deploy it
4. Public disclosure will happen **after** a fix is available, if necessary

## Responsible Disclosure

We kindly ask security researchers to:

- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond proof of concept
